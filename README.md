The Open CPPS Benchmark (OCPPS) is a project for all that are interested in benchmarking their code for anomaly detection in Cyber-Physical Production Systems data. Qualitative and quantitative datasets are pretty rare for this field of application and therefore we want to supply some evaluated datasets to compare the various methods that exist in a unified manner.
OCPPS consists of a selection of realistic as well as artificially generated datasets that will be automatically downloaded and preprocessed by our [***OCPPS-Package***](https://imb-benchmark.github.io/), that also consists of an standardized evaluator to enable reliable comparability.

Needless to say that we want to develop the project continuously, we want to adress you if you have discovered interesting datasets on which you want to perform a benchmark. If so, feel free to sent us your dataset to the following [**contact**](https://imb-benchmark.github.io//Contact.html?) and we will evaluate it for subsequent inclusion on our benchmarking website.

For issues or further questions please get in contact with us as well with the following [**contact**](https://imb-benchmark.github.io//Contact.html?).
